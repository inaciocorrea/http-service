# HTTP Service

A simple HTTP service for tests purpose. All responses are JSON econded.

I've created to play with NodeJS & ExpressJS.

## Possible requests:  

/ - Hello word  
/ip - Returns the Origin IP  
/user-agent - Returns (guess what?) user-agent  
/get - Returns data passed by GET  
/status/:code - Returns given HTTP status code  

## Installation:

```
git clone licor/http-request
npm install
npm run
```

## Special Thanks

This project is based on amazing service called [httpbin.org](http://httpbin.org). Thank you guys!
